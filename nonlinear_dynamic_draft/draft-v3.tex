% movtivation 
The wake-induced vibration (WIV) is highly nonlinear response charaterised by large transverse force 
and vibration in the post-lock-in region or galloping type vibration of download cylinder in the tandem arrangement. 
The recent studies \cite{Mysa2016,MYSA201727} examine the origin of WIV to the shifting stagnation point on the downstream cylinder or external unbalance rotating effects induced by the interaction between 
the upstream vortex shedding and the downstream cylinder.
Following the stability analysis of \cite{yao_jfm_1} for vortex-induced vibration (VIV) mechanism, 
we report the alternative explanation of the WIV mechanism in this study via eigenvalue distribution and the coupled 
wake and structural modes. 
% 
We consider the model reduction approach to construct the eigenvalue representation of WIV system and 
perform the stability analysis to examine the underlying process of WIV in the tandem cylinders. 
The model reduction of the fluid system is constructed by the eigensysem realization algorithm (ERA) and 
coupled with a transversely vibrating bluff body in a state space format. Unlike the wake-oscillator model, 
the ERA-based ROM does not rely on any empirical formulation and captures naturally the linear fluid dynamics
through the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. 
%
The results show that the WIV region and the onset reduced velocity 
$U_r$ can be predicted accurately by tracing the eigenvalue trajectories of the ROM for a range of $U_r$. 
The stability analysis reveals that it is the persisting unstable eigenvalue branch that sustains WIV, which 
implies that the highly nonlinear behavior has its linear origin. 
%
The sharp corner of square cylinder 
is found to have the stabilizing effects, therefore, the WIV onset $U_r$ is larger than its circular cylinder counterpart. 
%%
The work extends our previous understanding of the vortex induced vibration (VIV) lock-in mechanism to
WIV at low Reynolds number and provides an further understanding of WIV.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

% definition  VIV 
Vortex-induced vibration (VIV) is a complex nonlinear coupling between a structure and the flow dynamics, which 
often results in large transverse motion and reduces the structural fatigue life. 
This phenomenon has an impact in the broad fields of offshore, wind, aerospace and energy harvesting engineering due to 
its richness in fluid physics. In the VIV lock-in regime, the vortex shedding frequency deviates from the Strouhal
law and lock on to the structure natural frequency. This frequency lock-in phenomenon is typically characterized by 
high structure amplitude and therefore has been an active topic over the past decade (\cite{sarpkaya2004,Williamson2004,bearman2011}). 

%% VIV mechanism 
The commonly accepted interpretation of VIVs is attributed to the classical resonance, which depends on 
vortex shedding frequency ($f_{vs}$) matching structure natural frequency ($f_N$). However, numerical simulation has shown that 
the peak amplitude arises in the vicinity of lock-in onset rather than at $f_{vs}/f_N \approx 1$. Recently, Yao and Jaiman \cite{yao_jfm_1} 
developed an efficient VIV reduced order model (ROM) using eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) and successfully performed
stability analysis of VIV system. 
The authors show that the lock-in onset of bluff bodies is trigged by unstable structure mode (SM), and 
the low frequency galloping is characterized by persisting unstable SM. 
The understanding of lock-in mechanism by ERA-based ROM 
paves a way to develop a feedback control strategy for VIV suppression \cite{yao_jfm_2}. 


%%definition WIV 
The wake induced vibration or WIV is considered as the flow induced vibration in tandem 
configuration. The nature of VIV and WIV arises similarly from wake instability. However, WIV has its particular physics 
feature. Based on spacing to diameter ratio ($L/D$), the tandem cylinder is characterized by 
three interference regimes \cite{Mysa2016,ZDRAVKOVICH1987239,1981323}: proximity interference ($1 \le L/D \le 1.2$ to $1.8$), 
wake interference ($1.8 \le L/D \le 3.4$ to $3.8$) and no interference ($L/D \ge 3.8$).
In proximity regime, the vortex shedding
from the upstream cylinder is suppressed and the tandem bodies behave like a single bluff body, whereas the flow becomes intricate 
in wake interference and shear layer reattachment, intermittent vortex shedding, etc gradually appear as $L/D$ increases. 
The no interference regime is dominated by the co-shedding, where vortex shedding occurs separately from both the cylinders.

%% WIV mechanism 

The downstream cylinder experiences large response persisting to high reduced velocity 
which is typically defined as wake induced galloping \cite{bokaian1984}. Recent work 
\cite{assi2010} dissocates the WIV from galloping concept. The authors argue the WIV is 
sustained by unsteady vortex shedding that provides energy to the WIV system, 
and has different mechanism from VIV, which is considered as 
as a \textit{resonance} phenomenon. In another recent work \cite{assi2013}, the authors provided a 
physical explanation for WIV by wake-stiffness concept. They argued that the wake-stiffness characterizes the 
WIV properties. The authors \cite{assi2010,assi2013} insists that the WIV is a non-resonance 
fluid induced vibration (FIV) with increasing amplitudes beyond frequency lock-in regime, and is mainly due to 
unsteady wake. 
% Weigang: Provide review based on our two JFS papers

\cite{Mysa2016} investigated the origin of WIV at low Reynolds number $(Re,m^*,L)=(100,2.6,5D)$. 
The authors contribute the large transverse vibration in the post-lock-in region to the 
continuous vorticity shed from the upstream cylinder impinging on the downstream. The interaction 
can in turn shift the stagnation point of downstream cylinder closer to low suction region and 
decrease the suction pressure compared to isolated cylinder, which leads to a larger transverse force 
and transverse vibration. Recently, Analogous to the linear force  oscillator, the same authors \cite{MYSA201727} idelaize the 
WIV system as a linear mass spring model with a periodic force and a rotation effects. The steady solution 
of the spring-mass with the rotation excitation does not decay for high frequency ratio ($f/f_N >> 1$) or 
in the post-lock-in region. The aforementioned physical insight are concluded at $Re>Re_{cr}$ or 
the unsteady vortex shedding commences. As shown in section \ref{sec:WIV_circular}, the large transverse 
vibration or galloping type response also appears at $Re<Re_{cr}$ or the flow is stable. Therefore, it is 
still worthwhile to exploring the origin of the WIV. 

% Weigang: Add a paragraph to clearly articulate the focus and contributions of this paper
In our previous work for VIV stability analysis \cite{yao_jfm_1}, we demonstrated that 
forward triangle cylinder galloping type response is sustained by persisting unstable eigenvalue branch 
of linear VIV system constructed by ERA method. In the present work, we extend the physical insight to 
WIV by performing the linear stability analysis for the WIV system. We will show that the WIV 
galloping type WIV response shares the same linear stability mechanism as forward triangle cylinder. 
Compared with a circular cylinder counterpart, we show that the sharp corner of square cylinders also stabilize the WIV 
system or fluid-structure coupling in the sense that the WIV onset reduced velocity is postpone and the WIV
amplitude is also reduced significantly. 
%%
The paper is organized as follows. Section  \ref{sec:Numeric method} introduceds the FOM, ERA and ERA-based WIV ROM 
formulation in state space format. Section \ref{sec:set-up} describes the problem set-up. The results are discussed 
in section \ref{sec:Results} followed by conclusion in section \ref{sec:conclusion}. 

\section{Numerical methodology}\label{sec:Numeric method}
\subsection{Full-order model formulation}

Consider the fluid domain $\Otf$ with the spatial and temporal coordinates 
denoted by $\xx$ and $t$, respectively.
%
The Navier-Stokes (NS) equations governing an incompressible flow  
in the ALE reference frame are
\begin{gather}
\rho^\mathrm{f} \left( \frac{\partial \bu^\mathrm{f}}{\partial t} \bigg\rvert_{\bchi} + \left(\bu^\mathrm{f}-\bw\right)\cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla} \bu^
\mathrm{f} \right ) = \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}^\mathrm{f} + \mathbf{b}^\mathrm{f} \mbox{ on } \Otf \label{eq:N-S}, \\
\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot\bu^\mathrm{f} = 0 \mbox{ on } \Otf \label{eq:continuity},
\end{gather}
where $\rho^\mathrm{f}$, $\bu^\mathrm{f}$, 
$\bw$, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^\mathrm{f}$, and $\mathbf{b}^\mathrm{f}$ 
are the fluid density, the fluid velocity, the ALE mesh velocity, the 
Cauchy stress tensor and the body force per unit mass, respectively. 
%
For the partial time derivative in Eq. (\ref{eq:N-S}), 
the ALE referential coordinate $\bchi$ is held fixed and for a Newtonian fluid
$\boldsymbol{\sigma}^\mathrm{f}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\sigma}^\mathrm{f} = -p\mathbf{I} + \mu^\mathrm{f}\left(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \bu^\mathrm{f} + \left(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \bu^\mathrm{f}\right)^T
\right),
\label{eq:cauchyStress}
\end{equation}
%
where $p$, $\mu^\mathrm{f}$ and $ \mathbf{I} $ are the  pressure, the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and an identity tensor, respectively.
The ALE mesh nodes on the fluid domain $\Omega^f(\xx,t)$ can be updated by solving a linear steady pseudo-elastic material model
\begin{gather}
\div \cdot \stress^\mathrm{m} = \vec{0}, \\
\qquad \stress^\mathrm{m} = (1+k_\mathrm{m})\left[\left(\div \vec{\eta}^\mathrm{f}+\left(\div
\vec{\eta}^\mathrm{f}\right)^T\right)+\left(\div \cdot \vec{\eta}^\mathrm{f}\right)\vec{\mathrm{I}} \right], 
\label{MeshEq}
\end{gather} 
where $\stress^\mathrm{m}$ is the stress experienced by the ALE mesh due 
to the strain induced by the rigid-body movement, 
$\vec{\eta}^\mathrm{f}$ represents the ALE mesh node displacement and 
$k_\mathrm{m}$ is a mesh stiffness variable chosen as a function of the element area to 
limit the distortion of small elements located in the immediate vicinity 
of the fluid-body interface.
The WIV FOM or fluid-structure coupling is achieved 
through a partitioned staggered procedure \cite{Jaiman2011,yao_jfm_1}. 
%

Given a base flow $\bu_0$, the corresponding linearized NS equations can be written in a semi-discrete form as \cite{yao_jfm_2}, 
\begin{equation}
\mathsfbi{E}\frac{d \mathsfbi{Q} }{d t} = \mathsfbi{F} \mathsfbi{Q},
\label{eq:NS_pr}
\end{equation}
where the matrices and vectors in Eq.~(\ref{eq:NS_pr}) are
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
 \mathsfbi{F}=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
  -\left(  \right)\cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla} \bu_0 - \bu_0 \cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla} \left(  \right)+ \mu \left(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \left(  \right)
   + \boldsymbol{\nabla}^T\left( \right) \right)
     & -\boldsymbol{\nabla}\left(  \right) \\
 \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \left(  \right) & \mathsfbi{0}
\end{array}  \right),
\label{eq:NS_state_space}
\end{equation} 


%
\begin{equation}
\mathsfbi{G} = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
  \left(  \right)\cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla} \bu_0 & \mathsfbi{0} \\
 \mathsfbi{0}  & \mathsfbi{0}
\end{array}  \right),
\mathsfbi{E} = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
  \mathsfbi{I} & \mathsfbi{0} \\
 \mathsfbi{0}  & \mathsfbi{0}
\end{array}  \right),
\mathsfbi{Q} = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
  \bu \\
  p
\end{array}  \right).
\label{eq:NS_EQ}
\end{equation} 
\end{subequations}

The forward and adjoint modes can be derived by solving generalized eigenvalue problem of linearized NS equation
Eq.~(\ref{eq:NS_pr}), which can be written as
$(\mathsfbi{A_f} + \sigma \mathsfbi{B_f}) \mathsfbi{p} =\mathsfbi{0}$, 
where the non-symmetric matrices $\mathsfbi{A_f}$ and $\mathsfbi{B_f}$ 
results from the spatial and temporal discretizations, 
$\sigma$ denotes the eigenvalue of the discretized system,
$\mathsfbi{p}$ is the right eigenvectors (forward modes). 
The corresponding discrete adjoint problem can be obtained as
$\mathsfbi{q} (\mathsfbi{A_f} + \sigma \mathsfbi{B_f})  =\mathsfbi{0}$, 
where $\mathsfbi{q}$ is the left eigenvector of the discrete system 
and represents the approximation of the adjoint modes \cite{Luchini2007}.


%
\subsection{ERA-based model reduction}
The linear time-invariant (LTI) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) model represented in a state-space form 
at discrete times $t=k\Delta t$, 
$k=0,1,2,...,$ with a constant sampling time $\Delta t$ reads 
\begin{equation}
\left. \begin{array}{ll}

\displaystyle \mathsfbi{x}_{r}(k+1)=\mathsfbi{A}_{r}\mathsfbi{x}_{r}(k)+\mathsfbi{B}_{r}\mathsfbi{u}(k)  \\[8pt]

\displaystyle \mathsfbi{y}_{r}(k)=\mathsfbi{C}_{r}\mathsfbi{x}_{r}(k)+\mathsfbi{D}_{r}\mathsfbi{u}(k) 
\end{array}\right\},
 \label{eq:ERA_ROM}
\end{equation}  
where $\mathsfbi{x}_r$ is an $n_r$-dimensional state vector, 
$\mathsfbi{u}$ denotes a $q$-dimensional input vector 
and $\mathsfbi{y}_r$ is a $p$-dimensional output vector.  
The system matrices are $\left(\mathsfbi{A}_r,\mathsfbi{B}_r,\mathsfbi{C}_r,\mathsfbi{D}_r\right)$
and derived from ERA method \cite{Juang1985}. 
To construct the ERA-based ROM, 
the impulse response of NS equation is first defined as $\mathsfbi{y}$, based on which
the generalized block Hankel matrix $r \times s$ can be constructed as
\begin{equation}
\mathsfbi{H}(k-1) = 
\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}c}
    \mathsfbi{y}_{k+1}&     \mathsfbi{y}_{k+2}& ...& \mathsfbi{y}_{k+s}        \\    
    \mathsfbi{y}_{k+2}& \mathsfbi{y}_{k+3}& ...& \mathsfbi{y}_{k+s+1}    \\
    \vdots& \vdots& \ddots& \vdots        \\
    \mathsfbi{y}_{k+r}& \mathsfbi{y}_{k+r+1}& ...&\mathsfbi{y}_{k+(s+r-1)}
 \end{array} } \right],
\label{eq:Hankel}
\end{equation}  
and by applying singular value decomposition (SVD) of Hankel matrix $\mathsfbi{H}(0)$ as
\begin{equation}
\mathsfbi{H}(0) = \mathsfbi{U}\mathsfbi{\Sigma}\mathsfbi{V}^*=
\left[\mathsfbi{U}_1 \quad \mathsfbi{U}_2\right]
\left[{\begin{array}{*{20}c}
   \mathsfbi{\Sigma}_1 \quad \mathsfbi{0} \\
   \mathsfbi{0} \quad \mathsfbi{\Sigma}_2
 \end{array} }
\right]
\left[{\begin{array}{*{20}c}
  \mathsfbi{V}_1^* \\
  \mathsfbi{V}_2^*
 \end{array} }
\right]
\end{equation}
where the diagonal matrix $\Sigma$ are the Hankel singular values (HSVs). 
The block matrix $\Sigma_2$ contains the zeros or 
negligible elements. By truncating the dynamically less significant states, we estimate 
$\mathsfbi{H}(0) \approx \mathsfbi{U}_1\mathsfbi{\Sigma}_1\mathsfbi{V}_1^*$. 
The state space matrices $(\mathsfbi{A}_{r}, \mathsfbi{B}_{r}, \mathsfbi{C}_{r}, \mathsfbi{D}_{r})$ are obtained by
\begin{equation}
\left. \begin{array}{ll}

\displaystyle \mathsfbi{A}_{r}=\Sigma^{-1/2}_{1}\mathsfbi{U}^{*}_{1}\mathsfbi{H}(1)\mathsfbi{V}_{1}\Sigma^{-1/2}_{1} \\
\displaystyle \mathsfbi{B}_{r}=\Sigma^{1/2}_{1}\mathsfbi{V}^{*}_{1}\mathsfbi{E_m}   \\
\displaystyle \mathsfbi{C}_{r}=\mathsfbi{E_t}^{*}\mathsfbi{U}_{1}\Sigma^{1/2}_{1}   \\    
\displaystyle \mathsfbi{D}_{r}=\mathsfbi{y}_{1}
\end{array}\right\}
 \label{eq:ERA_ROM_matrices}
\end{equation}  
Here, $\mathsfbi{E_m}^*=\left[\mathsfbi{I}_q \quad \mathsfbi{0} \right]_{q\times N}$, 
$\mathsfbi{E_t}^{*}=\left[\mathsfbi{I}_p \quad \mathsfbi{0} \right]_{p \times M}$, where
$N =s \times q$, $M =r \times p$, and $\mathsfbi{I}_{p,q}$ are the identity matrices. 



\subsection{Reduced order model for WIV}

In the present work, we only consider the transverse motion of cylinder for the sake of simplicity \cite{yao_jfm_1}.
The structural governing equations can be expressed as,
 
\begin{equation}
{\ddot{Y} + 4\zeta\pi F_{s}\dot{Y} + (2\pi F_{s})^2 Y}=\frac{a_{s}}{m^{*}} C_{l},
\label{eq:structure1}
\end{equation}

where $Y$ is the transverse displacement; $C_{l}$ is the lift coefficient, 
$m^{*}$ and $\zeta$ are the ratio of the mass of the vibrating structure to the mass of the displaced fluid and the 
damping coefficient, respectively; $F_{s}$ is the reduced natural frequency of the structure 
defined as $F_{s}=f_{N}D/U = 1/U_r$, where $U_r$ is the reduced velocity.$a_{s}=\frac{2}{\pi}$ for a circular cylinder, 
and  $a_{s}=0.5$ for a square cylinder.
Equation \eqref{eq:structure1} can be casted into space format as, 

\begin{equation}
 \dot{\mathsfbi{x_{s}}}=\mathsfbi{A_{s}}\mathsfbi{x_{s}}+\mathsfbi{B_{s}}C_l,
\label{eq:state}
\end{equation} 
where the state matrices and vectors are
\[ 
	\mathsfbi{A_{s}}=\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
	0 & 1\\
	 -(2\pi F_{s})^2 &-4\zeta\pi F_{s}      
 	\end{array} \right], \quad
 	\mathsfbi{B_{s}}=\left[ \begin{array}{c}
 	0 \\
 	\frac{a_{s}}{m^{*}}
	\end{array}  \right], \quad
	\mathsfbi{x_{s}}=\left[ \begin{array}{c}
 	Y \\
 	\dot{Y}
	\end{array}  \right].
 \] 

The resultant fluid and structure coupled system ROM is formulated as,
\begin{equation}
 \mathsfbi{x_{fs}}(k+1)=\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
 \mathsfbi{A_{sd}}+\mathsfbi{B_{sd}}\mathsfbi{D_{r}}\mathsfbi{C_{sd}} & \mathsfbi{B_{sd}}\mathsfbi{C_{r}} \\
 \mathsfbi{B_{r}}\mathsfbi{C_{sd}} & \mathsfbi{A_{r}}
 
\end{array}  \right]\mathsfbi{x_{fs}}(k) =\mathsfbi{A_{fs}}\mathsfbi{x_{fs}}(k),
\label{eq:wivrom}
\end{equation} 

where  $\mathsfbi{A_{sd}}=e^{\mathsfbi{A_{s}}\Delta t}$, $\mathsfbi{B_{sd}}={\mathsfbi{A_{s}}}^{-1}(e^{\mathsfbi{A_{s}}\Delta t}-\vec{\mathrm{I}})\mathsfbi{B_s}$.

\section{Numerical set-up and verification}\label{sec:set-up}

\subsection{Problem definition}\label{sec:prob}
Similar to \cite{yao_jfm_1}, figure \ref{fig:schematic} shows a schematic diagram of the setup used for WIV linear stability analysis. 
The coordinate origin is located at the center of the two bluff bodies.
The streamwise and transverse directions are denoted $x$ and $y$, respectively.
%
A stream of incompressible fluid enters into the domain from an 
inlet boundary $\mathrm{\Gamma_{in}}$ at a horizontal velocity $(u,v)=(U,0)$, where $u$ and $v$ 
denote the streamwise and transverse velocities, respectively. 
The downstream bluff body with mass $m$ and characteristic diameter $D$ is mounted on a linear spring 
in the transverse direction. The damping coefficient $\zeta$ is set to zero in the present work.
%
The domain size is similarly set up as \cite{yao_jfm_1}. 
No-slip wall condition is implemented on the surfaces of the bluff body, and a traction-free
boundary condition is implemented along the outlet $\mathrm{\Gamma_{out}}$
while the slip wall condition is implemented on the top $\mathrm{\Gamma_{top}}$
and bottom $\mathrm{\Gamma_{bottom}}$ boundaries. 
%
All length scales are normalized by 
the characteristic dimension $D$, velocities
with the free stream velocity $U$, and frequencies with $U/D$.
%
The Reynolds number $Re$ of flow is based on the
characteristic dimension $D$, kinematic viscosity of fluid 
and free-stream speed $U$.
%
According to the mesh convergence study in \cite{yao_jfm_1}, we consider 
the mesh consisting of 20912 $\mathbb{P}_{2}/\mathbb{P}_{1}$ 
iso-parametric elements is sufficient for current WIV stability study. 
%
The mesh is shown in figure \ref{fig:mesh} and 
the corresponding central rectangle represents the fine mesh region around the cylinder bodies. 
The mesh in the cylinder wake is appropriately refined to resolve 
the alternate vortex shedding.

\subsection{Stability analysis of stationary tandem cylinder}\label{sec:lsa}

At $(Re,L)=(60,2D)$, the WIV ERA-based ROM is first constructed for circular cylinder 
tandum configuration. The based flow, as shown in the figure \ref{fig:baseflow}, is computed via fixed point iteration without the 
time dependent term in the NS equation. 
Following the ERA-based ROM construction procedure in \cite{yao_jfm_1}, 
1000 impulse outputs ($C_l$) are stacked by imposing $\delta (t) = 10^{-4}$
on the transverse displacement $Y$ of downstream cylinder with time step size $\Delta t = 0.05$.
Subsequently, $25^{th}$ ROM is determined by examining the decaying singular value of Hankel matrix \cite{Juang1985}. 
A good match between FOM and $25^{th}$ ROM is found in figure \ref{fig:signal}(b).The FOM results 
are derived by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem of Eq.~(\ref{eq:NS_pr}).
The impulse response gradully diverges at $Re=120$
and indicates that real part of the least damped eigenvalue is positive and the uncoupled fluid system is unstable. 
On the other hand, the decaying impulse response is observed for $Re=60$ and indicates the stalbe fluid system. 
%
The least damped eigenvalue predictred by ERA-based ROM is compared with FOM in figure \ref{fig:fomeig}. 
It is evident that the flow becomes unstable 
when $Re_{cr} \approx 90$ or the real part of the least damped eigenvalue approaches zero.

\section{Results and discussion}\label{sec:Results}
% Describe overall layout of results and discussion


\subsection{WIV of circular cylinder}\label{sec:WIV_circular}

%%
Figure \ref{fig:ld2_eig} shows the root loci of the WIV ERA-based ROM as a function of reduced 
velocity $U_r$ with $2 \le U_r \le 40$. Following the earlier work of \cite{yao_jfm_1}, the terminology 
WMI and WMII is adopted to classify the eigenvalue branches. 
% definition of the terminologies 
As shown in \cite{yao_jfm_1}, a classification of the fluid-structure eigenmodes as 
WM and SM is suitable for weak fluid-structure interaction 
(e.g., very large mass ratio). Owing to weaker fluid-structure coupling 
at large $m^*$ (i.e., in the limit of $m^* \to \infty$),  the eigenfrequency 
of WM approaches to that of the stationary cylinder wake for all values of $F_s$ and 
the frequency of SM comes close to the natural frequency of the cylinder-only system.
%
However, the root loci of WM and SM can coalesce   
and form coupled modes at certain conditions, such as in the limit of 
low mass ratio \cite{meliga2011,mittal2016} and for different geometrical shapes \cite{yao_jfm_1}.  
We term these mixed or coupled modes 
as the wake-structure mode I (WSMI) and the wake-structure mode II (WSMII).
%
For higher value of $F_s$,  WSMI behaves as WM and WSMII recovers to SM.
On the other hand, for smaller $F_s$ range, WSMI and WSMII  represent the SM and
WM, respectively.
%%
As can be seen, 
the WMII branch arises from the high frequency region or the top
of the complex plane, while the WMI branch originates from the uncoupled mode and travels down to the low frequency 
or bottom of the complex plane. 
As elucidated in the figure \ref{fig:ld2_eig}, 
the real part of WMII branch remains unstable when $U_r \ge 6.1$ and WMI branch is stable, 
which indicates the WIV persists at $m^*=2$. The finding is further 
confirmed by the FOM in figure \ref{fig:fom_2_ycl}, where the WIV onset $U_r=5.9$ and the WIV remains for $U_r \ge 5.9$. 
%
Figure \ref{fig:ld2_eig} shows that the WMI branch is only unstable when $7.44 \le U_r \le 11.0$ at $m^*=20$, which is evident 
from the figure \ref{fig:fom_2_ycl}. 
Furthermore, in figure \ref{fig:ld2_eig}(b) (bottom), the Im$(\lambda)$ plot shows the charateristic anticrossing between WMI and WMII for 
the low mass ratio $m^*=2$. This intrinsic property of strong coupling system is also found for 
the single cylinder VIV system at low mass ration \cite{yao_jfm_1}. 
The two counter-rotating vortices (2S mode) are released at onset $U_r=5.9$ and $(Re,m^*,L)=(60,2,2D)$ 
as shown in figure \ref{fig:fom_2_onset_vor}. 
%% response 
The figure \ref{fig:m2_fom} and \ref{fig:m20_fom} depict the transverse displacement and lift traces with the 
corresponding spectrum, which confirms the high harmonid response of WIV. 

%%

Apart from the unstable eigenvalue branches, it is also interesting to see the WIV from the engergy transfer viewpoint.
The engery transfer over one period $T$ for WIV system is derived as equation \ref{eq:Energy_transfer} 
in Appendix A. The $E_c$ is defined by excluding the exponential growth/decay rate. The figure \ref{fig:energy} suggests 
that energy source to sustain the WIV is the unstable WMII at $(Re,L)=(60,2D)$.

As shown \ref{fig:ld2_eig_re100}, the uncoupled mode moves to the right half-complex-plane at $Re=100$. 
Compared with root loci at $Re=60$, figure \ref{fig:ld2_eig_re100} shows that the eigenvalue branches 
moves to high frequency regime or upper part of complex plane. The onset $U_r$ of WIV predicted by ERA-based ROM 
is at $U_r \approx 5.4$.

% Weigang: We need to elaborate discussion. Also please add the results for difference gap ratios. Otherwise the results do not look general and convincing. I understand it may not change the main message of our paper, but we need the spacing effects for the completeness.

\subsection{Effect of longitudinal spacing}
The longitudinal spacing ($L/D$) is a key parameter in WIV. As $L/D \to \infty$, the isolated cylinder recovers 
from tandum configuration. The figure \ref{fig:dfl_eig} shows that the uncoupled fluid mode moves toward to 
the right half complex plane as $L/D$ increases. It implies that the $Re_{cr}$ reduces and the coupling
is enhanced in the sense that the WIV onset reduced velocity starts to move
towards the low reduced velocity (high $F_s$) as the spacing $L/D$ increases.

\subsection{Effect of sharp corners}\label{sec:WIV_square}

In this section, we further explore the WIV of square cylinder to understand the role of sharp corners with respect to 
smooth contours of circular geometry. In our previous work \cite{yao_jfm_1}, 
we demonstrated that the sharp corner has stabilizing effects for fluid structure coupling. Therefore, 
it is interesting to investigate the WIV mechanism of square cylinder by means of ERA-based ROM.
The flow region with high sensitivity and strong response or wavemaker region is determined by computing the pointwise 
product of the forward and adjoint global modes \cite{Luchini2007}. 
Figure \ref{fig:wavemaker} shows that the wavemaker region of the circular tandem cylinder has higher value and 
moves closer to the cylinders than its circular counterpart, which suggests that the circular tandem cylinder 
has stronger fluid and structure interaction level.

\section{Concluding remarks}\label{sec:conclusion}
WIV is a highly nonlinear response characterized by high amplitude in post-lock-in region. 
In this study, we adopted ERA-based model reduction to investigate the origin of WIV phenomena. 
The ERA-based ROM only relies on the impulse response of the NS equations and is efficient 
for stability analysis of nonlinear fluid and structure coupling system. 
Based on the systematic parametric study, the following conclusions can be drawn:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{
The persisting unstable eigenvalue branch sustains the WIV in the post-lock-in 
region. The results also show that the WIV can persist even at $Re<Re_{cr}$, whereas the authors in \cite{Mysa2016,MYSA201727} only consider the unsteady vortex shed from the upstream cylinder impinging on the downstream cylinder as the origin of 
this nonlinear behavior. 
}

\item{
The analysis on the spacing ($L/D$) effect of tandum cylinder study at $(Re,m^*)=(60,2)$ 
shows that the least damping eigenvalue moves to right-half complex plane. Therefore, the 
$Re_{cr}$ reduces as increasing $L/D$. 
The structrue and fluid coupling effect is enhances as the longitudinal spacing ($L/D$) increases 
in the sense that the WIV onset reduced velocity $(U_r)$ moves to low reduced velocity. 

}


\item{
The analysis of square cylinder shows that the sharp corner has the stabilizing effect for 
fluid and structure interaction in the sense that onset reduced velocity is postponed and amplitude is reduced significantly. 


}
\end{enumerate}

While the WIV is a nonlinear response, the present work suggests that it has the linear origin. Hence, 
linear stability analysis lays a foundation to develop feedback control strategy to stabilize the WIV system 
by shifting the unstable eigenvalues to left-complex-half plane. 


\section*{Appendix A: Energy Transfer for WIV}\label{app:A} 

Following our previous work on VIV \cite{yao_jfm_1}, 
the displacement and lift coefficient can be obtained  for the WIV linear system as, 
 
\begin{equation}
\left. \begin{array}{ll}
\displaystyle Y=\hat{Y} e^{\lambda_r t}\cos(\lambda_i t)  \\[8pt]
\displaystyle C_l=\hat{C_l} e^{\lambda_r t}\cos(\lambda_i t + \phi)
\end{array}\right\},
\label{eq:linear_y_cl}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda=\lambda_r+i\lambda_i$ is eigenvalue with real $\lambda_r$ 
and imaginary $\lambda_i$ components, $\hat{Y}$ and $\hat{C_l}$ 
denote the magnitudes of eigenmodes. The phase angle difference is derived 
by pluging the Eq. (\ref{eq:linear_y_cl}) into Eq. (\ref{eq:structure1}), and refer
to \cite{yao_jfm_1} for details. 

\begin{equation}
\sin{\phi} = \frac{2\lambda_r\lambda_i}{\sqrt{(\lambda_r^2  \\
+ (2\pi F_s)^2 + \lambda_i^2)^2 - (4\pi\lambda_i F_s)^2 }}.
\label{eq:phase_angle}
\end{equation}

The engery transfer per cycle is defined as,

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ll}
\displaystyle E(t) = \int_{t}^{t+\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda_i}} \dot{Y} \hat{C_l} dt \\
\displaystyle  = \frac{1}{2}(\lambda_i \sin(\phi) + \lambda_r \cos(\phi) + \lambda_r \cos(2 \lambda_i t + \phi))
\int_{t}^{t+\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda_i}} e^{2 \lambda_r t} dt
\end{array}
\label{eq:Energy_transfer}
\end{equation}

$E_c$ is defined by excluding the exponential growth/decay rate $\lambda_r$ in Eq. (\ref{eq:Energy_transfer}),
\begin{equation}
E_c = \pi \hat{Y} \hat{C_l} \sin(\phi)
\end{equation}
